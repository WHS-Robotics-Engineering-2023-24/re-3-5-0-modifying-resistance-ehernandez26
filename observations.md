The first thing that I observe between the three (four) circuits is that they all had two resistors with all the same amount of Ohms. I also realized that the way that they were organized had changed how much resistance was in play. 
I know that the more resistors, in some cases, means less resistance so it is hard to say what the exact relationship is between the two. Although, for the most part, the current reamins the same with more or less resistance.
For example, in the first circuit it begins with 25.79 mA and ends with the same amount. 
I believe that using the resistors in a series or parallel manner would be to decrease the amount of Voltage rather than the Amps, or current.
